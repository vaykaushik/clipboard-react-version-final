This responsive project involved the following iterations from the last non-React vanilla version:

-- Code is written using the BEM (Block, element, modifier) convention.

1) Used Sass to create mixins.
2) Used Yarn to install FontAwesome libary for icons and manipulate.
3) Created reusable components i.e. 'Button'.
